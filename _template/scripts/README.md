# scripts/ — mechanical ingest

These ship inside the KB so it stays self-contained and splittable. Detection is a pure
script (no LLM, no cost); the actual ingest invokes Claude Code headlessly.

> **Run these where `raw/` actually resolves — your real machine, not a container or
> remote sandbox.** Sources are often symlinks to local mounts (shared drives, OneDrive,
> etc.). Inside a container those symlinks are broken, so a scan there fingerprints
> *emptiness* and an ingest captures nothing. Sanity check: if
> `find -L raw/<source> -type f | wc -l` is `0` for a source you know has files, the mount
> isn't present — you're in the wrong place.

## `sweep` — move shared intake into the protected store

`inbox/` is a shareable staging directory; `raw/` is the protected source store you never
share. `sweep` **moves** each item from `inbox/` into `raw/` and commits the move — so
once curated, a source leaves the shared area and contributors can't alter or delete it.

```sh
./scripts/sweep            # move inbox/* → raw/ and commit
./scripts/sweep --dry-run  # show what would move; move nothing
```

It runs automatically as the first step of `ingest` (disable with `--no-sweep`).
Name collisions never overwrite a `raw/` source — the incoming item is timestamp-suffixed.

## `scan` — detect changes

Walks `raw/`, fingerprints each source (following symlinks into living drives), and diffs
against `.ingest/manifest.tsv`. Writes the queue to `.ingest/pending.md`.

```sh
./scripts/scan          # detect; exit 0 = clean, 10 = changes pending
./scripts/scan --accept # advance the baseline to current state (used after ingest)
./scripts/scan --refresh # freshness check: flag read coverage items whose doc changed = stale
```

`scan` (no flag) is also the drift check the Lint workflow calls; `--refresh` is the
per-document freshness check that drives re-reading (see Progressive deepening).

## `ingest` — detect + ingest

```sh
./scripts/ingest            # Pass 1 "read": read HIGH-value docs in full
./scripts/ingest --map      # Pass 0 "map": cheap skeleton + build coverage frontier
./scripts/ingest --deepen   # Pass 2+: read the next highest-value unread OR stale docs
./scripts/ingest --fresh    # prioritise re-reading stale (changed) docs over new coverage
./scripts/ingest --budget 5 # soft per-pass spend target (USD)
./scripts/ingest --watch    # live play-by-play of each step
./scripts/ingest --dry-run  # show what would run; no LLM, no changes
./scripts/ingest --auto     # unattended permissions — for cron / launchd
```

### Progressive deepening

Ingestion is an **anytime, iterative-deepening** loop. Run `--map` once for a cheap
skeleton that enumerates the corpus into `.ingest/coverage.tsv` (the read frontier, ordered
by value: `notes.md` priorities, then a document-type heuristic). Then a default **read**
pass reads the high-value docs; repeat `--deepen` to read progressively more, value-first.
Stop after any pass — the wiki is usable throughout and the next run resumes the frontier.
`--budget $N` caps a pass; watch actual spend in `.ingest/cost.tsv`.

**Freshness.** A deepen pass auto-detects documents that changed since they were read
(`scan --refresh` flips them to `stale`) and re-reads them by value — the frontier is
`unread ∪ stale`. Default order is value-first (stale beats unread *within* a tier);
`--fresh` reconciles all stale before expanding. It's the web-crawler coverage-vs-freshness
trade-off, weighted by importance.

Full reference — the two ledgers, the algorithm, and a guardrailed operator playbook:
[`../docs/deepening.md`](../docs/deepening.md).

Flags combine (e.g. `--watch --auto`). Without `--watch` you get the agent's final summary
when it finishes; **`log.md` is the durable record either way** (what was ingested + every
`[!review]` flag). `--watch` streams each step live (read/write/etc.) — it uses
`--output-format stream-json` rendered readable through `jq`; install `jq` for clean output,
or you'll see raw JSON. `--auto` stays quiet and logs to `.ingest/auto.log`.

If `claude` isn't on your PATH: `CLAUDE_BIN=/full/path/to/claude ./scripts/ingest`.

### Cost & model

When `jq` is installed, each run appends a row to `.ingest/cost.tsv` —
`date · cost_usd · turns · duration_ms · sources · mode · model` (the model actually used,
read from the run's init event) — and prints the run cost plus a running cumulative total.
The ledger is committed, so cost history travels with the KB:

```sh
awk -F'\t' '$1!~/^#/{s+=$2} END{printf "total $%.4f\n", s}' .ingest/cost.tsv
```

The ingest model defaults to **`claude-opus-4-8`**. Override per run with `CLAUDE_MODEL`:

```sh
CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6 ./scripts/ingest   # cheaper/faster for small batches
```

On success it advances `.ingest/manifest.tsv` and commits. The manifest only advances when
the ingest run exits cleanly, so an interrupted run leaves the queue intact for next time.

## Opt-in auto-ingest

Enable this once you trust the supervised flow. Both options run `ingest --auto` on
a cadence; runs where `raw/` hasn't changed do nothing (detection is free). Replace
`KBPATH` with this KB's absolute path.

> Auto mode runs Claude Code with `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` so it can write
> unattended. Only enable it when you're comfortable with what supervised runs produce.
