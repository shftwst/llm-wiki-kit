# scripts/ — mechanical ingest

These ship inside the KB so it stays self-contained and splittable. Detection is a pure
script (no LLM, no cost); the actual ingest invokes Claude Code headlessly.

> **Run these where `raw/` actually resolves — your real machine, not a container or
> remote sandbox.** Sources are often symlinks to local mounts (shared drives, OneDrive,
> etc.). Inside a container those symlinks are broken, so a scan there fingerprints
> *emptiness* and an ingest captures nothing. Sanity check: if
> `find -L raw/<source> -type f | wc -l` is `0` for a source you know has files, the mount
> isn't present — you're in the wrong place.

## `scan.sh` — detect changes

Walks `raw/`, fingerprints each source (following symlinks into living drives), and diffs
against `.ingest/manifest.tsv`. Writes the queue to `.ingest/pending.md`.

```sh
./scripts/scan.sh          # detect; exit 0 = clean, 10 = changes pending
./scripts/scan.sh --accept # advance the baseline to current state (used after ingest)
```

This is also the drift check the Lint workflow calls — it covers files, directories, and
living symlink targets in one pass.

## `ingest-new.sh` — detect + ingest

```sh
./scripts/ingest-new.sh            # supervised: scan, then ingest pending via Claude Code
./scripts/ingest-new.sh --watch    # supervised + live play-by-play of each step
./scripts/ingest-new.sh --dry-run  # show what would run; no LLM, no changes
./scripts/ingest-new.sh --auto     # unattended permissions — for cron / launchd
```

Flags combine (e.g. `--watch --auto`). Without `--watch` you get the agent's final summary
when it finishes; **`log.md` is the durable record either way** (what was ingested + every
`[!review]` flag). `--watch` streams each step live (read/write/etc.) — it uses
`--output-format stream-json` rendered readable through `jq`; install `jq` for clean output,
or you'll see raw JSON. `--auto` stays quiet and logs to `.ingest/auto.log`.

If `claude` isn't on your PATH: `CLAUDE_BIN=/full/path/to/claude ./scripts/ingest-new.sh`.

On success it advances `.ingest/manifest.tsv` and commits. The manifest only advances when
the ingest run exits cleanly, so an interrupted run leaves the queue intact for next time.

## Opt-in auto-ingest

Enable this once you trust the supervised flow. Both options run `ingest-new.sh --auto` on
a cadence; runs where `raw/` hasn't changed do nothing (detection is free). Replace
`KBPATH` with this KB's absolute path.

> Auto mode runs Claude Code with `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` so it can write
> unattended. Only enable it when you're comfortable with what supervised runs produce.
