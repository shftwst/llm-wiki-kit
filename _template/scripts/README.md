# scripts/: mechanical ingest

These ship inside the KB so it stays self-contained and splittable. Detection is a pure
script (no LLM, no cost); the actual ingest invokes Claude Code headlessly.

> **Run these where `raw/` actually resolves, your real machine, not a container or
> remote sandbox.** Sources are often symlinks to local mounts (shared drives, OneDrive,
> etc.). Inside a container those symlinks are broken, so a scan there fingerprints
> *emptiness* and an ingest captures nothing. Sanity check: if
> `find -L raw/<source> -type f | wc -l` is `0` for a source you know has files, the mount
> isn't present, you're in the wrong place.

## Schema config (`.schema/`)

Two TSVs define this KB's vocabularies; edit them to fit your domain (the scripts read them
through `scripts/kblib.sh`):

- **`.schema/page-types.tsv`** — the `type:` values (`type · class · dir · note`). `class` is
  `content` (needs `## Sources`, prose is subject-only, carries a privilege tier), `source`
  (provenance is the page's subject), or `nav` (catalog/home pages, skipped when publishing).
  `lint` validates every page's `type` against this list.
- **`.schema/privilege-tiers.tsv`** — the `privilege:` ladder (`tier · rank · classify · note`),
  ordered least to most sensitive. `lint` validates `privilege`; `classify` maps its keyword
  buckets to the tiers marked `business` / `personal`; `.publish/roles.tsv` grants each role a
  subset of these tiers.

## `sweep`: move shared intake into the protected store

`inbox/` is a shareable staging directory; `raw/` is the protected source store you never
share. `sweep` **moves** each item from `inbox/` into `raw/` and commits the move, so
once curated, a source leaves the shared area and contributors can't alter or delete it.

```sh
./scripts/sweep            # move inbox/* → raw/ and commit
./scripts/sweep --dry-run  # show what would move; move nothing
```

It runs automatically as the first step of `ingest` (disable with `--no-sweep`).
Name collisions never overwrite a `raw/` source, the incoming item is timestamp-suffixed.
Items matching `.ingestignore` and zero-byte files are skipped as junk and left in `inbox/`.

## `lint`: mechanical QA

Structural, style, and privacy checks over `wiki/`. No LLM, no cost.

```sh
./scripts/lint          # full report; exit 0 if no errors, 1 otherwise
./scripts/lint --quiet  # errors + summary only
```

Checks: frontmatter completeness and valid enums (errors); missing `## Sources` and
all-`not read` pages; dangling `[[links]]` and orphan pages; stale derived pages
(`derived_from` page newer than `as_of`); style tells (banned vocabulary, curly quotes,
em-dash overuse); privacy heuristics (SIN-shaped numbers, credential keywords); and **docs
style** (the same tells across `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README`, and `docs/`, since `STYLE.md` governs
docs too). It is the cheap pre-check; the LLM Lint workflow and the verify pass go deeper.

## `stats`: ingestion summary

A read-only dashboard over the state ledgers and `wiki/`. No LLM, no cost.

```sh
./scripts/stats          # sources, coverage (read/partial/unread/stale), wiki pages, cost
./scripts/stats --check  # also resolve each coverage path on disk (flags missing/unreadable)
```

Reports: documents by read status and value tier, the remaining frontier, read-vs-not-read
counts with not-read reasons (timed-out = unreadable this pass), wiki pages by type and
privilege tier, open `[!review]` flags, sensitivity counts, and total cost broken down by
pass mode and model.

## `classify`: estimate sensitivity

Tags each coverage item with a sensitivity tier (`default | business-sensitive |
personal-sensitive`) from path and keyword heuristics. No LLM, no cost, never reads document
contents. Tiers come from `.schema/privilege-tiers.tsv` (the keyword buckets map to whichever tiers
are marked `business` / `personal`). Fail-safe: an unmatched item falls to a conservative floor
(`CLASSIFY_FLOOR`, default = the `business`-bucket tier). Writes `.ingest/sensitivity.tsv`.

```sh
./scripts/classify            # classify all coverage items
./scripts/classify --dry-run  # print the classification; write nothing
CLASSIFY_FLOOR=default ./scripts/classify   # change the fail-safe floor
```

This is Phase 1 of the sensitivity-aware routing design ([`docs/routing.md`] in the kit).
It only tags; nothing routes on the tag yet. Run it after `--map` populates the frontier.

## `publish`: role-filtered views for the web

Build a read-only, shareable view of the wiki for a role, including only the pages that role
is cleared to see. Roles and their allowed privilege tiers live in `.publish/roles.tsv`; add
a row to make a view for any role.

```sh
./scripts/publish team             # filter team-cleared pages and build the site with Quartz
./scripts/publish team --serve     # build + live preview at http://localhost:8080
./scripts/publish client --dry-run # report what each role would include/exclude
./scripts/publish --all            # build every role's site into .publish/sites/<role>/
./scripts/publish --all --dry-run  # report include/exclude for every role; write nothing
```

Pages above the role's clearance are excluded; links to excluded pages and all `../raw/`
citation links are de-linked, so the site has no broken links and no paths into private
sources. `index.md` and `overview.md` are skipped (they catalog the whole graph); a minimal
role-view `index.md` is generated so the site root resolves, and Quartz builds its own nav.

One Quartz instance serves one role at a time, so `--all` writes each role to its own static
output dir (`.publish/sites/<role>/`) you can open or host; preview one live with
`publish <role> --serve`.

The site title (Quartz's header and the landing page) is the KB's own title, read from the
`wiki/overview.md` `title:`/H1 the ingest infers from the sources, falling back to the
`AGENTS.md` H1 then the folder name. Override per build with `KB_TITLE="My KB" ./scripts/publish team`.

[Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) is an Obsidian-aware static site generator: it understands
`[[wikilinks]]` and callouts, unlike plain GitHub. If it is not present, `publish` installs it
once automatically (git clone + `npm i`) into `QUARTZ_DIR` (default `.publish/quartz`, which is
gitignored and disposable — delete it to force a fresh clone). Without git or npm, the filtered
content is staged under `.publish/<role>/content/` with build instructions.

## `scan`: detect changes

Walks `raw/`, fingerprints each source (following symlinks into living drives), and diffs
against `.ingest/manifest.tsv`. Writes the queue to `.ingest/pending.md`. Names in
`.ingestignore` and zero-byte files are skipped as junk; sources with identical content are
flagged as possible duplicates.

```sh
./scripts/scan          # detect; exit 0 = clean, 10 = changes pending
./scripts/scan --accept # advance the baseline to current state (used after ingest)
./scripts/scan --refresh # freshness check: flag read coverage items whose doc changed = stale
```

`scan` (no flag) is also the drift check the Lint workflow calls; `--refresh` is the
per-document freshness check that drives re-reading (see Progressive deepening).

## `ingest`: detect + ingest

```sh
./scripts/ingest            # Pass 1 "read": read HIGH-value docs in full
./scripts/ingest --map      # Pass 0 "map": cheap skeleton + build coverage frontier
./scripts/ingest --deepen   # Pass 2+: read the next highest-value unread OR stale docs
./scripts/ingest --verify   # QA: adversarial auditor re-reads sources, writes .ingest/qa.tsv
./scripts/ingest --sample 8 # verify: audit at most N pages this run
./scripts/ingest --fresh    # prioritise re-reading stale (changed) docs over new coverage
./scripts/ingest --budget 5 # soft per-pass spend target (USD)
./scripts/ingest --watch    # live play-by-play of each step
./scripts/ingest --dry-run  # show what would run; no LLM, no changes
./scripts/ingest --auto     # unattended permissions, for cron / launchd
```

### Progressive deepening

Ingestion is an **anytime, iterative-deepening** loop. Run `--map` once for a cheap
skeleton that enumerates the corpus into `.ingest/coverage.tsv` (the read frontier, ordered
by value: `notes.md` priorities, then a document-type heuristic). Then a default **read**
pass reads the high-value docs; repeat `--deepen` to read progressively more, value-first.
Stop after any pass, the wiki is usable throughout and the next run resumes the frontier.
`--budget $N` caps a pass; watch actual spend in `.ingest/cost.tsv`.

**Freshness.** A deepen pass auto-detects documents that changed since they were read
(`scan --refresh` flips them to `stale`) and re-reads them by value, the frontier is
`unread ∪ stale`. Default order is value-first (stale beats unread *within* a tier);
`--fresh` reconciles all stale before expanding. It's the web-crawler coverage-vs-freshness
trade-off, weighted by importance.

**Verification (`--verify`).** A separate, adversarial QA pass: it re-reads the cited
sources for the highest-risk pages, confirms each claim or flags it (`> [!review]`), and
writes a row per page to `.ingest/qa.tsv` (`status · claims_checked · claims_supported ·
confidence`). `--sample N` caps pages; `--budget $N` caps spend. `stats` reports
`% verified`. It does not sweep, ingest, or touch the manifest, QA only.

Full reference, the two ledgers, the algorithm, and a guardrailed operator playbook:
[`../docs/deepening.md`](../docs/deepening.md).

Flags combine (e.g. `--watch --auto`). Without `--watch` you get the agent's final summary
when it finishes; **`log.md` is the durable record either way** (what was ingested + every
`[!review]` flag). `--watch` streams each step live (read/write/etc.), it uses
`--output-format stream-json` rendered readable through `jq`; install `jq` for clean output,
or you'll see raw JSON. `--auto` stays quiet and logs to `.ingest/auto.log`.

If `claude` isn't on your PATH: `CLAUDE_BIN=/full/path/to/claude ./scripts/ingest`.

### Cost & model

When `jq` is installed, each run appends a row to `.ingest/cost.tsv`:
`date · cost_usd · turns · duration_ms · sources · mode · model` (the model actually used,
read from the run's init event), and prints the run cost plus a running cumulative total.
The ledger is committed, so cost history travels with the KB:

```sh
awk -F'\t' '$1!~/^#/{s+=$2} END{printf "total $%.4f\n", s}' .ingest/cost.tsv
```

The ingest model defaults to **`claude-opus-4-8`**. Override per run with `CLAUDE_MODEL`:

```sh
CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6 ./scripts/ingest   # cheaper/faster for small batches
```

On success it advances `.ingest/manifest.tsv` and commits. The manifest only advances when
the ingest run exits cleanly, so an interrupted run leaves the queue intact for next time.

## Opt-in auto-ingest

Enable this once you trust the supervised flow. Both options run `ingest --auto` on
a cadence; runs where `raw/` hasn't changed do nothing (detection is free). Replace
`KBPATH` with this KB's absolute path.

> Auto mode runs Claude Code with `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` so it can write
> unattended. Only enable it when you're comfortable with what supervised runs produce.
